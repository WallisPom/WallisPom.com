In 2006, Elon Musk wrote a plan for the future of a small electric car company he co-founded several years prior. Little would we know that this plan was just the beginning of a future empire.
What was in this [master plan](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me)? Well, the premise was simple on paper:
1. Build a sports car
2. Use that money to build an affordable car
3. Use that money to build an even more affordable car
4. While doing the steps above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options

On July 20, 2016, while in the final stages of completion, Elon published Master Plan, Part Deux. 
So, what is this second master plan, and what why will it propel Tesla to be among the largest companies in the world?

###### Master Plan Part Deux
From Tesla’s blog page, here is [part 2](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/master-plan-part-deux) of their master plan:
1. Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage
2. Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments
3. Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning
4. Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it


###### Cars: Past, Present, Future?
Where does the majority of Tesla’s current revenue come from? Well, cars. Where will it be in 5, or 10 years? A vertically integrated energy company with millions of vehicles acting as mobile data centers.

###### Solar
In 2016, Tesla acquired Solar City, a US company that manufactures and installs residential and commercial solar panels. Since then, Tesla has expanded its offering to include solar roof tiles, meant to be indistinguishable from regular shingles. Up until now, its solar business has been sidelined by the car business; this will change in the coming years.
But why solar and not something like hydro?
The availability of solar energy generation is global. The penetration of sunlight may vary by region, but the fact remains:  The sun knows no borders.

###### Batteries:  A glimpse of the future?
The sun may provide an abundant supply of energy, but the equation isn’t complete until we find a place to store it. 
At the time of this post, Tesla has yet to have battery investor day. Leading up to this highly anticipated event, Tesla has hinted at achieving a breakthrough in battery technology and manufacturing through acquisitions like [Maxwell Technologies](https://electrek.co/2020/01/21/tesla-acquisition-maxwell-big-impact-battery-elon-musk/) and [Hibar Systems](https://insideevs.com/news/375375/tesla-buys-hibar-systems-batteries/). 
This breakthrough has been touted as the elusive One Million Mile Battery. Such a battery will be capable of several thousand full charge and discharge cycles without significant degradation. 
So why is a million-mile battery necessary?

###### Autonomy
Fully self-driving vehicles is a highly controversial topic. It wouldn’t take much effort to find numerous experts claiming such technology is over a [decade](https://www.futurecar.com/3400/Experts-Claim-Autonomous-Cars-Are-Still-a-Decade-Away-Report-States) away, and I won’t try to convince you otherwise. What I will say is that the company who will likely win the race to full autonomy is the one with the most data. Tesla has over [700,000](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/01/05/over-730000-tesla-vehicles-with-autopilot-2-3-on-the-road/) cars on the road collecting billions of miles of real-world data, and the lead grows with each successive vehicle produced. Tesla has also boldly stated that all cars produced since October 2016 have the [hardware necessary for full self-driving](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware), only the software is not yet available. If such a claim is proven true, they can merely send out an over-the-air software update overnight, and a fleet of self-driving cars awakens come dawn.

###### Ride-sharing
If and when Tesla has achieved full autonomy, they will likely have millions of vehicles on the road. When self-driving technology is approved by regulators, ridesharing opens the door to a [multi-trillion dollar opportunity](https://ark-invest.com/analyst-research/teslas-autonomous-opportunity/), yet it's largely absent from most valuation models.
This Robo-taxi future is the reason why it’s necessary to have a million-mile battery. The average car only has a [5% utility rate](https://fortune.com/2016/03/13/cars-parked-95-percent-of-time/), meaning it spends the majority of time stationary in a parking lot. Should an owner choose to do so, they can add their Tesla to the Robot-taxi network and have their vehicle transport people when not in use. This fundamentally changes the economics of vehicle ownership.

###### Electric cars, trucks, aircraft?

Tesla’s main focus is to produce as many vehicles as possible. Even so, in 2019, Tesla only delivered [367,500 vehicles](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q4-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries), a pittance compared to legacy auto manufacturers like Ford who had vehicle wholesales of over [5 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/380104/global-vehicle-sales-of-ford/) in the same year. However, it's important to appreciate that Tesla's 5-year revenue compounded annual growth rate is [50.4%](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:TSLA/explorer/total_rev_cagr_5y) whereas Ford's is [5.6%](https://finbox.com/NYSE:F/explorer/interest_exp_cagr_5y). 
In fact, the main thing holding Tesla back from producing more vehicles is its [supply of batteries](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18305976/tesla-panasonic-gigafactory-batteries-model-3). Once Tesla unveils its next-generation battery technology and scales up production, products such as the Cybertruck, Semi, and Roadster V2 will see the light of day. As for an electric jet - That is sadly a pipe dream for now.

###### Final Words
If you are a prospective investor, I believe you should ask two questions:  First, what is Tesla's ability to expand battery production drastically above its current levels, and second, how close is Tesla to solving the self-driving problem?
